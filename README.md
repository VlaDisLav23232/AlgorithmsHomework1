## Prerequisites

To build and run this program, you must have the following installed:

1.  **C++ Compiler:** `g++` (supporting C++17)
2.  **Build Tool:** `make`
3.  **Python 3:** With the following libraries installed:
    * `pandas`
    * `matplotlib`
    * `seaborn`
    * `numpy`

You can install the Python libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Building the program and running

1) Run `make` to compile all needed files
2) Then run `./demo` to execute the demo-program that calculates the operations and time for all functions and sorting as stated in the task.
3) When program finishes, it creates results.csv. To vizualize it use 
```bash
python plot_results.py
```

4) To clean up everything just use `make clean`.
